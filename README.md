# Waves of Words: Tools for studying Australia's past

A suite of functions for querying (Trove)[https://trove.nla.gov.au] and extracting useful results in R.

## Usage

Simply download the `helper_functions.R` file, and run it in your R session using the `source` command.

You will need to get an API key from Trove, which you can do for free from anywhere in the world. If you save your key as a variable called `api_key` in the global environment, the functions will pick it up automatically.
